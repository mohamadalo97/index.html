In this exercise, students learn DOM manipulation. They also will hopefully
learn about the disadvantages of putting all variables directly into the Global
Object (`window`). In the next lesson, we will package all the properties of the
ball into an object, to keep the `window` global object clean and prevent
variable collisions.
