In this exercise, students learn how to work with an object. They also learn
about how to change the properties of an object, and then to separately use that
object's properties to update the DOM. They also learn the concept of an initial
"constructor" of a new object.

They will then be asked to make a second ball, and will learn the limitations of
building static objects manually, as in order to make a second ball, a lot of
code will need to be duplicated.

This will lead into using Object Oriented Programming in a future lesson.
